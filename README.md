# Project Scope and Objectives

This project defines the scope and objectives for a customer segmentation analysis that distinguishes UK and international buyers using purchasing frequency, recency, and spending patterns. The aim is to organize customers into meaningful groups that can guide market-specific marketing and commercial efforts.

We will work with transactional data from December 2010 to December 2011, address known issues such as missing CustomerID values, ambiguous cancellations or adjustments, and inconsistent descriptions, and engineer features that capture repeat purchase intervals such as the average days between purchases, recency in days, and monetary value. We will then apply unsupervised clustering, using K-means with an elbow-based check for the number of clusters.

The outputs will be clear segment definitions and profiles that support targeted campaigns and resource allocation. The specific business question, stakeholder groups, and risk considerations are detailed in the sections below.

#### Busniess Question:

- How do domestic (UK) and international customers cluster based on purchasing frequency, purchasing recency, and spending patterns in order to identify high-value customer groups and design targeted marketing strategies?

#### Stakeholders:

- Business Development Team:
- Marketing and Customer Insights Team: 
- Data Science/Analytics Team:

#### Risks and uncertainties:

- Uncertainties: 
    i.      Having sufficient data, especially for international markets, to assess whether clusters are representative.
    ii.     Ambiguity in cancellation reasons.
    iii.    Data spans December 2010 to December 2011 only. External factors such as economic conditions, seasonality, and promotional cycles may have influenced purchasing and cancellation behavior, so findings
            should be generalized cautiously to future years.
    iv.     Other factors not modeled directly, such as delivery times, customer service experience, and online purchasing experience.

- Risks:
    i.      Target segments may not be substantially present in the customer base.
    ii.     Insights may be biased due to insufficient data.
