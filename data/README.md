## Datasets

- **Online Retail Dataset I:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail)

**Note:**

The datasets are publicly available. To keep the repository size manageable, **do not commit large data files**. For local work, download/extract the datasets and/or generate processed datasets in the appropriate folder and keep them untracked by Git (via `.gitignore`).

Obtain the raw data by running the Jupyter notebook `notebooks/00_fetch_raw_data.ipynb` once (or as needed) for local development.
